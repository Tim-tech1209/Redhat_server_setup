## YOU CAN'T BUY A DOMAIN IN AZURE!!!
## the DNS zones in Azure is just a place that you can link your domain that you buy somewhere else to your VM in Azure.


## CHECK YOUR NAMECHEAP/DOMAIN LIST/**YOUR DOMAIN**/ADVANCED DNS
## ADD AN A RECORD, AND CHANGE TTL TO 60, NOT AUTOMATIC.

## USE DIG COMMAND WHEN YOU ARE NOT SURE WHETHER YOU GOT YOUR DOMAIN REGISTERRED RIGHT OR NOT.
## THE RESULT OF DIG SHOULD BE RIGHT LIKE BELOW.

  [root@R1 ~]# dig **YOUR_DOMAIN.com**

  ; <<>> DiG 9.16.23-RH <<>> **YOUR_DOMAIN.com**

## YOU ONLY NEED TO FOCUS ON "status" and "AUTHORITY SECTION". AS LONG AS THEY ARE GOOD, YOU JUST NEED TO WAIT FOR SERVERL MINUTES.
## WHEN IT IS READY, YOU WILL SEE AN ANSWER SECTION WITH IP ADDRESS.
